# Elearning
### A Scalable, Secure, and Performance-Optimized LMS

## Overview

**Elearning** is an online learning system that allows users to explore and access courses across various categories. It‚Äôs designed for flexibility; learners can watch lessons on their schedule, froam any device, with a clean and responsive interface.

The platform includes features like **course management**, **user management**, **OTP-based authentication**, and **DRM-protected video streaming**. Both users and admins have dedicated dashboards to manage their roles, track progress, and handle tasks their easily.

This project focuses on building a reliable system with a clear structure, strong security practices, and a smooth user experience. Everything is designed to be fast, stable, and easy to maintain.

## Architecture

### System Architecture Diagram

### Frontend

Users access the platform through their browser. The **Next.js** frontend handles login/signup with JWT tokens and OTP verification. It makes REST API calls to get data and uses Socket.IO for real-time notifications.

### Backend

The **Node.js API server** processes all requests. It has rate limiting to prevent spam and handles authentication, course management, and email sending. Socket.IO pushes live updates to connected users.

### Database

**MongoDB Atlas** stores everything - user profiles, courses, orders, questions, and reviews. The backend reads and writes data here for all operations.

### External Services

**VdoCipher** handles video streaming with DRM protection. Only enrolled students can watch course videos.
**Cloudinary** stores and serves media files like profile pictures and course thumbnails.
### How It Works

1. User interacts with frontend
2. Frontend calls backend API
3. Backend processes request and updates MongoDB
4. Backend sends response back
4. Videos stream from VdoCipher
5. Images load from Cloudinary

Simple flow: Browser ‚Üí Next.js ‚Üí API Server ‚Üí MongoDB ‚Üí External Services.

### Entity Relationship Diagram

This ERD maps out the LMS structure. Everything connects around these collections: `users`, `courses`, `orders`, `notifications`, and `layouts`. Other collections support and extend their roles.

### Entities

| collection     | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| users         | All users (students, admins). Handles login, roles, and profiles.       |
| courses       | Main course info, video content, reviews, and orders.                   |
| orders        | Tracks course purchases made by users. Used for payments and history.   |
| notifications | Stores alerts per user (order updates, comment replies, etc.).          |
| layouts       | Admin-defined frontend sections (hero, FAQ, categories, banners).       |

### Relationship Tables

| collections      | Connected To        | Role                                                        |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| courseData        | courses             | Stores all lessons (video + metadata) under a course.       |
| benefits          | courses             | Lists learning outcomes for a course.                       |
| prerequisites     | courses             | Lists required knowledge before taking the course.          |
| reviews           | users, courses      | Course ratings by users.                                    |
| comments          | users, courseData   | Q&A system for video content or reviews.                    |
| links             | courseData          | Additional learning resources (external).                   |
| user_courses      | users, courses      | Tracks who enrolled, progress, and completion status.       |
| faqItems          | layouts             | FAQ content for frontend.                                   |
| categories        | layouts             | Course categorization, shown on UI.                         |
| bannerImages      | layouts             | Home banners stored and served dynamically.                 |

### How Everything Flows

- A `user` enrolls in a `course` ‚Üí tracked in `user_courses`.
- That user can make an `order` ‚Üí creates a purchase record.
- After purchase, `notifications` are sent to the user.
- The `course` shows `courseData` (videos), each video can have `comments` and `links`.
- `reviews` are tied to both `users` and `courses` for feedback.
- The home layout is managed through `layouts`, connected to `categories`, `faqItems`, and `bannerImages`.

- OTP-based auth using nodemailer + expiry logic  
- JWT + HTTP-only cookies for session security  
- Rate Limiting with express-rate-limit

**Access Control**
- Role-based access (admin, student)  

**API & State Management**
- RESTful API structure with consistent status codes  
- Real-time updates handled via Socket.IO  
- State managed with RTK Query + Redux Toolkit  
- Postman for testing, GitHub for version control  

**Performance & Reliability**
- Redis Caching (with ioredis)

## Conclusion

This LMS wasn‚Äôt just about building features it was about solving real problems like secure access, smooth content delivery, and reliable course management. I focused on writing clean backend logic, handling edge cases, and keeping the frontend experience fast and responsive. It helped me understand how to architect a full-stack system, not just build one.
